# AIR QUALITY ALERT THRESHOLDS CONFIGURATION
# 
# This file defines the concentration limits used by the 'evaluate_alerts' 
# function to categorize pollutant levels into severity tiers (Low, Medium, High).
#
# Logic:
# - Low: Concentration is within safe/baseline limits.
# - Medium: Concentration is elevated; requires monitoring.
# - High: Concentration exceeds safety standards; triggers critical alerts.

thresholds:
  # Carbon Monoxide (CO)
  # Standard measurement typically in mg/m³
  co:
    low: 2.0
    medium: 4.0
    high: 9.0        # Based on typical 8-hour exposure limits
    unit: "mg/m³"
    description: "Carbon Monoxide"
  
  # Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
  # High levels are often associated with vehicle emissions and respiratory issues
  no2:
    low: 100
    medium: 200
    high: 400
    unit: "µg/m³"
    description: "Nitrogen Dioxide"
  
  # Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
  # Represents the sum of NO and NO2
  nox:
    low: 150
    medium: 300
    high: 600
    unit: "µg/m³"
    description: "Nitrogen Oxides"
  
  # Benzene
  # A known carcinogen; thresholds are strictly enforced even at lower values
  benzene:
    low: 5.0
    medium: 10.0
    high: 20.0
